# Result list for pathways

When the excel file is processed, CMM returns to the user a list of results with the pathways ordered (see [file-structure](file-structure.md). The figure below an example of a list of pathways present in an excel file ordered using this approach. The results are also available in excel format if the user wants to work with it.
