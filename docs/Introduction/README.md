# Introduction

Ceu Mass Mediator (CMM) is an on-line tool for aiding researchers when performing metabolite annotation. CMM integrates compounds from different sources (HMDB, LipidMaps, KEGG, Metlin and compounds from in-house libraries developed at CEMBIO -Centro de Excelencia en Metabolómica y Bioanálisis, http://www.metabolomica.uspceu.es) based on the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI).

The versions used for its database are:

- HMDB: Files downloaded from http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads. 
Version 4.0. Updated on 17/01/2019.
- KEGG: Rest API (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html). Updated on 17/01/2019.
- LipidMaps: Files downloaded from http://www.lipidmaps.org/resources/downloads/index.html. Updated on 17/01/2019. 
- Metlin. Links obtained from other sources (PubChem, KEGG, HMDB, LipidMaps). Updated on 17/01/2019.
- In-House Library. Created at CEMBIO. Updated on 31/03/2018.
- MINE: JavaScript API (https://github.com/JamesJeffryes/MINE-API). Updated on 17/01/2019.

Furthermore, CMM scores the putative annotations using three types of rules, explained in detail in section 2.6. 
This manual describes the available features in CMM. These features are shown below and are described in their corresponding sections of the manual.
