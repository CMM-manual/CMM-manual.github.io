# Overall score

Each one of the aspects described above has an important impact on the final quality of the spectrum. Therefore, an overall score is proposed to reflect all characteristics within a single value. This score is obtained by summing all partial scores and consequently ranges from 0 to 5 points. Within this range three levels have been established: 
1. Excellent spectra with cumulative score between 5.0 and 3.5 points.
2. Acceptable spectra with overall score between 3.5 and 2.0 points. 
3. Inadequate spectra with score less than or equal to 2.0 points. 
This overall score can be used in two ways: either to discard low quality spectra from the annotation process or to rank identified metabolites according to the confidence of annotation.

The user can load some data for example and can reset all the fields. When the user has introduced all the input data, it is necessary to click process. The results obtained for the input parameters with a result for an excellent spectrum is shown below:
