# Spectra Quality Controller

The spectra quality controller is a tool for analyzing how reliable is the spectrum obtained by the user with the purpose of identifying the primal metabolite in untargeted Metabolomics. Due to the limited number of available authentic standards, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis is a crucial method in metabolite annotation. However, it is very easy to overlook low quality spectra which carry a higher risk of miss-annotation. For this reason, a profound study of hundreds of MS/MS spectra from several biological studies have been performed to establish criteria for evaluation of spectral quality. As a result, a pentagonal-point evaluation system including aspects such as overall intensity of spectra, impact of noise, number of MS/MS scans obtained, co-eluting ions and cross-talk phenomena has been established. These aspects are evaluated giving a partial score between 0 and 1. Then, an overall score is calculated by summation of all previously obtained scores and used to classify spectra as excellent, acceptable or inadequate in a three-tier scoring system.
